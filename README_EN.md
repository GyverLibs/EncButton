|--- |

A light and very functional library for an encoder with a button, encoder or buttons with Arduino
- Button
    - processing of events: pressing, releasing, click, click counter, retention, impulse retention, deduction time + preliminary clicks for all modes
    - Program suppression of rubbish
    - support for processing two simultaneously pressed buttons as a third button
- Encoder
    - Processing of events: a normal turn, pressed turn, fast turn
    - Support of four types of incidental encoders
    - high -precision algorithm for determining the position
    - buffer in interruption
- simple and understandable use
- a huge number of opportunities and their combinations for different scenarios for using even one button
- virtual regime (for example, for working with a pain expander)
- optimized to work in interruption
- The fastest reading of pins for AVR (Atmega328/Atmega168, Attiny85/Attiny13)
- Fast asynchronous algorithms of survey of actions from the button and encoder
- rigid optimization and low weight in Flash and SRAM memory: 5 bytes SRAM (on an instance) and ~ 350 bytes Flash to process the button

Examples of use scenarios:
- Several clicks - inclusion of the regime (according to the number of clicks)
- Several clicks + short retention - another option for turning on the mode (according to the number of clicks)
- several clicks + holding - a gradual change in the value of the selected variable (on the number of clicks)
- Several clicks choose a variable, encoder changes it
- changing the step of changes in the variable during the rotation of the encoder - for example, a decrease with a closed button and an increase with rapid rotation
- navigation by menu during the rotation of the encoder, a change in the variable during the rotation of a clamped encoder
- full -fledged navigation by the menu when using two buttons (simultaneous retention to go to the next level, simultaneous pressing for return to the previous one)
- And so on

## Installation
- The library can be found by the name ** encbutton ** and installed through the library manager in:
    - Arduino ide
    - Arduino ide v2
    - Platformio
- [download the library] (https://github.com/gyverlibs/encbuton/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) .Zip archive for manual installation:
    - unpack and put in *C: \ Program Files (X86) \ Arduino \ Libraries* (Windows X64)
    - unpack and put in * C: \ Program Files \ Arduino \ Libraries * (Windows X32)
    - unpack and put in *documents/arduino/libraries/ *

- Read more detailed instructions for installing libraries [here] (https://alexgyver.ru/arduino-first/#%D0%A3%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%BD%D0%BE%BE%BE%BED0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA)
### Update
- I recommend always updating the library: errors and bugs are corrected in the new versions, as well as optimization and new features are added
- through the IDE library manager: find the library how to install and click "update"
- Manually: ** remove the folder with the old version **, and then put a new one in its place.“Replacement” cannot be done: sometimes in new versions, files that remain when replacing are deleted and can lead to errors!

## Information
## encoder
#### type of encoder
The library supports all 4 types of * incidental * encoders, the type can be configured using `setenctype (type)`:
- `eb_step4_Low` - active low signal (tightening to VCC).Full period (4 phases) per click.*Set by default*
- `eb_step4_high` - an active high signal (tightening to GND).Full period (4 phases) for one click
- `eb_step2` - half of the period (2 phases) per click
- `eb_step1` - a quarter of the period (1 phase) per click, as well as encoders without fixation

! [Diagram] (/doc/enc_type.png)

#### Recommendations
To work according to the Encoder with the button, I recommend these ([link] (https://ali.ski/cmpi2), [link] (https://ali.ski/szbtk)) Round Chinese modules with broken anti -ship chains(have the type `eb_step4_low` according to the classification above):
! [Scheme] (/doc/encali.png)

You can tie an encoder yourself according to the following scheme (RC filters to the encoder channels + tightening of all pens to VCC):
! [Scheme] (/doc/enc_scheme.png)

> Note: by default in the library of Pino Encoder, you are configured by `Input` with the calculation of an external luster.If you have an encoder without lifting, you can use the internal `Input_pullup`, indicating this in the initialization of the encoder (see the documentation below).

### Button
### The level of the button
The button can be connected to the microcontroller in two ways and give a high or low signal when pressed.The library provides for setting up `setbtnlevel (level)`, where the level is an active button signal:
- `High` - the button connects the VCC.Installed by default in `virt`-bibliotexes
- `Low` - the button connects GND.Set by default in the main libraries

! [Scheme] (/doc/btn_scheme.png)

#### Pin
In diagrams with microcontrollers, the connection of the GND button with a PIN suspension to VCC is most often used.The tightening can be external (Pin mode must be put `Input`) or internal (PIN mode` Input_pullup`).In "real" projects, an external lifelong is recommended, becauseIt is less susceptible to interference - the internal has too high resistance.

### classes
How to work with the documentation: Encbutton starting with version 3.0 is several libraries (classes) for various use scenarios, they inherit each other to expand functionality.Thus, the library is a “onion”, each layer of which has access to the functions of the lower layers:
- Basic classes:
  - `virtbutton` - the base class of the virtual button, provides all the possibilities of the buttons
  - `virtencoder` - the base class of the virtual encoder, determines the fact and direction of the rotation of the enkoder
  - `virtencbutton` - the base class of a virtual encoder with a button, provides an encoder poll taking into account the button, *inherits Virtbututton and Virtencoder *
- Main classes:
  - `Button`,` buttont` - button class, *inherits virtbutton *
  - `Encoder`,` Encodert` - Encoder class, *inherits virtencoder *
  - `ENCBUTTON`,` ENCBUTTONT` - ENCODER class with a button, *inherits VirtenCbutton, Virtbutton, Virtencoder *

Thus, to study all the available functions of a particular library, you need to watch not only it, but also what it inherits.For example, the button processing using `Button` must be opened below the description of` button` and `virtbutton`.

> * Virtual * - without specifying a PIN of the microcontroller, works directly with the transmitted value, for example, for a survey of the enemies buttons through pain extensors and shift registers.

> `T'- version of libraries require indicating Pino constants (numbers).Pino numbers will be stored in the memory of the program, this accelerates the work and makes the code easier by 1 byte for each pin.

> Note: `# Include <encbutton.h>` connects all the library tools!

### Processing and Poll
All libraries have a general ** function of processing ** (ticker `tick`), which receives the current signal from the button and encoder
- this function must be caused once in the main cycle of the program (for virtual - with the transmission of the meaning)
- the function returns `true` when the event occurs (for encoder -` 1` or `-1` when turning,` 0` in its absence. Thus, the turn in any direction is regarded as `true`)
- There are separate functions for calling in interruption, they have a suffix `isr`, see documentation below

The library processes the signal inside this function, the result can be obtained from ** functions of the survey ** events.They are of two types:
- `[event]` - the function will return `true` once upon the event of an event.It will be reset after the next call call (for example, click, turning enncoder)
- `[condition]` - the function returns `true`, while this condition is actively (for example, the button is held)

For simplicity of perception, the processing function must be placed at the beginning of the cycle, and polls do below:
`` `CPP
VOID loop () {
  btn.tick ();// survey

  if (btn.click ()) serial.println ("click");// will display once when clicking
  if (btn.click ()) serial.println ("click");// The same click!
}
`` `
> Unlike previous versions of the library, the survey functions are not reset inside themselves, but *inside the processing function *.Thus, in the example above, when clicking on the button in the port, the message `click ()` is displayed twice.This allows you to use the survey functions several times for the current iteration of the cycle to create a complex logic of the program.

#### several functions of processing
For obvious reasons, it is impossible to cause the processing function more than once per cycle - each next call will drop events from the previous one and the code will work incorrectly.So - you can’t:
`` `CPP
// you can not do it this way
VOID loop () {
  btn.tick ();
  if (btn.click ()) ...

  // ....

  btn.tick ();
  if (btn.hold ()) ...
}
`` `

If you really need to get into a deaf cycle and interrogate the button there, then it can: you can:
`` `CPP
// so it is possible
VOID loop () {
  btn.tick ();
  if (btn.click ()) ...

  While (True) {
    btn.tick ();
    if (btn.hold ()) ...
    if (btn.click ()) Break;
  }
}
`` `

If the library is used with an connected event handler `Attach ()` (see below), then you can call `tick ()` anywhere and as many times as you like, the events will be processed in the handler:
`` `CPP
// so it is possible
VOID CB () {
  switch (btn.action ()) {
    // ...
  }
}

VOID setup () {
  btn.attach (CB);
}

VOID loop () {
  btn.tick ();
  // ...
  btn.tick ();
  // ...
  btn.tick ();
}
`` `

### "loaded" program
The Encbutton - ** asynchronous ** library: it does not wait until the button is completed, and allows the program to be executed further.This means that for the correct operation of the library, the main cycle of the program should be performed as quickly as possible and not contain delays and other "deaf" cycles within itself.To ensure proper processing of the button, it is not recommended to have a main delay cycle lasting more than 50-100 ms.A few tips:
-beginners: to study the lesson cycle [how to write a sketch] (https://alexgyver.ru/lessns/how-to-sketch/)
  - write asynchronous code in `loop ()`
  - Any synchronous structure on `delay ()` can be made asynchronous using `millis ()` `
  - if in the program * each * main cycle is executed longer than 50-100ms- in most cases the program is written incorrectly, with the exception of some special cases
- connect the button to the hardware interruption (see below)
- avoid the execution of "heavy" sections of the code while theBota button, for example, by placing them in the condition `if (! Button.busy ()) {heavy code}`
- If it is impossible to optimize the main cycle - call the ticker in another "stream" and use the processor:
  - in interruption of a timer with a period of ~ 50ms or more often
  - on another core (for example, ESP32)
  - In another Task Freertos
  - inside `yield ()` (inside `delay ()`)

#### Separate processing
> It makes sense only with a manual survey of events!With a connected processing function, it is enough to call the usual `tick ()` between the heavy sections of the program

Also, in a loaded program, you can divide the processing and reset of events: instead of `tick ()` use `tickRAW ()` between heavy sections of the code and manual reset `Clear ()`.The order is as follows:
- Surrender actions (Click, Press, Turn ...)
- Call `Clear ()`
- call `tickRaW ()` between heavy sections of code

`` `
This will allow to interview the button/encoder in a not very well written program, where the main cycle is littered with heavy code.Inside the `Tickrade ()` Events accumulate that are dismantled once in the cycle, and then manually reset.

> In this scenario, the Encoder's buffering in the interruption does not work and all events are not processed `Releasexxx`

#### Processing inside Delay
If it is difficult to get rid of the `delay ()` inside the main cycle of the program, then on some platforms you can place your code inside it.Thus, you can even get encoder processing in a cycle with deals without using interruptions:
`` `CPP
// Code insertion in Delay
VOID yield () {
  EB.TickRAW ();
}

VOID loop () {
  if.click ()) ...
  if (btn.turn ()) ...

  eb.clear ();

  // ...
  Delay (10);
  // ...
  DELAY (50);
  // ...
}
`` `

> In this scenario, the Encoder's buffering in the interruption does not work and all events are not processed `Releasexxx`

#### button processing
The library processes the button as follows:
- Pressing with software suppression of rubbish (holding longer than the Deb time), the result is the event `Press`, the state of` Pressing` and `Busy`
- retention longer than the Hold Hold time - the event `hold`, the state` holding`
- holding longer than the Hold + Timeshot Timeshu Taimout - a pulse event `step`, triggers with the STEP period while the button holds
- release of the button, the result - the event `Release`, the removal of the states` Pressing` and `Holding`
  - release to the deduction time - event `click`
  - release after holding - event `Releasehold`
  - release after impulse deduction - event `ReleaseStep`
  - Events `Releasehold` and` ReleaseStep` mutually exclusive, if the button was withheld `step` -` Releasehold` will no longer work
- Waiting for a new click during the Click timeout, the state `Waiting`
- If there is no new click - the removal of the state of `Busy`, the processing is completed
  - If the button is pressed again - processing a new click
  - The Clicks Clicks `getClicks ()` is discarded after the events `Releasehold`/` Releastep`, which check the preliminary clicks.In the general processor `Action ()` Events `EB_REL_Hold_C` or` EB_REL_STEP_C`
  - The number of clicks made must be checked by the `Hasclicks` event, and you can also interview almost all the events of the buttons that go to` Releasexxx`
- If `Timeout` is expected - Timeout event with the specified period from the current moment
- processing the button in the interruption informs the library about the fact of pressing, the rest of the processing is performed regularly in `Tick ()` `

#### Encoder Processing
- "Fast" turn is considered to be a turn,cranberries in less than configured timout from the previous turn
- the turns processed in interruption become active (cause events) after calling `tick ()`
- Access to the encoder’s counter `Counter` is a public variable of the class, you can do anything with it:
`` `CPP
Serial.println (eb.counter);// read
Eb.counter += 1234;// change
eb.counter = 0;// Knock
`` `

#### encoder processing with a button
- The turning of the encoder with a clamped button removes and blocks all subsequent events and clicks, with the exception of the event `redase`.The states of the pressed button do not change
- The turning of the encoder also affects the system timout (the `timeout ()` function) will work after the indicated time after turning the enkoder

<a id="preclicks"> </a>

### Preliminary clicks
The library considers the number of clicks by the button and some survey functions can separately be processed with *preliminary clicks *.For example, 3 clicks, then retention.This greatly expands the capabilities of one button.There are two options for working with such events:
`` `CPP
  // 1
  if (btn.hold ()) {
    if (btn.getclics () == 2) serial.println ("Hold 2 Clicks");
  }

  // 2
  if (btn.hold (2)) serial.println ("Hold 2 Clicks");
`` `

In the first version, you can get the number of clicks for further processing manually, and in the second - the library will do this itself if the number of clicks for action is known in advance.

<a id="btnread"> </a>

## direct reading button
In some scenarios, you need to get the state of the "here and now" button, for example, determine whether the button is held immediately after starting the microcontroller (program start).The function `tick ()` must be called constantly in the cycle so that the button is processing with the extinguishing of the ratio of contacts and other calculations, so the design of the next type ** will not work **:
`` `CPP
VOID setup () {
  btn.tick ();
  if (btn.press ()) serial.println ("button pressed at start");
}
`` `

The following functions will help for such scenarios, return `true` if the button is pressed:
- `read ()` for libraries button and buttont
- `Readbtn ()` for library libraries and encbuttont

> The button survey is performed taking into account the previously configured button level (Setbtnlevel)!It is not necessary to manually invert the logic:

`` `CPP
VOID setup () {
  // btn.setbtnlevel (LOW);// you can configure the level

  if (btn.read ()) serial.println ("button pressed at start");
}
`` `

<a id="loop"> </a>

### immersion in the cycle
Suppose you need to process the button synchronously and with the extinguishing of the rattles.For example, if the button is clamped at the start of the microcontroller, get its retention or even the pulse retention inside the `setup` unit, that is, before the start of the main program.You can use the state of `Busy` and interview the button from the cycle:
`` `CPP
VOID setup () {
  Serial.Begin (115200);

  btn.tick ();
  While (btn.busy ()) {
    btn.tick ();
    if (btn.hold ()) serial.println ("Hold");
    if (btn.step ()) serial.println ("step");
  }

  Serial.println ("Program Start");
}
`` `
How it works: the first tick interrogates the button, if the button is pressed - the state of the Busy is immediately activated and the system enters the `While` cycle.Inside it, we continue to tick and get events from the button.When the button is released and all events will work - the Busy flag will drop and the program will automatically leave the cycle.You can rewrite this design to the cycle with a postcryption, more beautiful:
`` `CPP
do {
  btn.tick ();
  if (btn.hold ()) serial.println ("Hold");
  if (btn.step ()) serial.println ("step");
} While (btn.busy ());
`` `

<a id="timeout"> </a>

## Timeout
In the classes associated with the button (Button, Encbutton) there is a function `Timeout (Time)` - it will once return `true` if the indicated time has passed after the action with the button/encoder.This can be used to preserve parameters after entering, for example:
`` `CPP
VOID loop () {
  eb.tick ();

  // ...

  if.timeout (2000)) {
    // after interaction with encoder 2 seconds passed
    // eeprom.put (0, settings);
  }
}
`` `

<a id="busy"> </a>

### Busy
Function `Busy() `Returns` true` while the button is processing, i.e.So far, the system awaits actions and the release of timeouts.This can be used to optimize the code, for example, avoid some long and heavy parts of the program during the button processing:
`` `CPP
VOID loop () {
  eb.tick ();

  // ...

  if (! eb.busy ()) {
    // Potentially long and difficult code
  }
}
`` `

<a id="Actions"> </a>

### Obtaining an event
Available in all classes ** with the ** button:
- `virtbutton`
- `Button`
- `virtencbutton`
- `encbutton`

The function `Action ()` when the event occurs, the event is returned (different from scratch, which in itself is an indication of the existence of an event):
- `eb_press` - click on the button
- `eb_hold` - the button is kept
- `eb_step` - impulse retention
- `eb_release` - the button is released
- `eb_click` - Single click
- `eb_clicks` - A few click signal
- `eb_turn` - turn of the encoder
- `eb_rel_hold` - the button is released after holding
- `EB_REL_HOLD_C` - the button is released after holding off the premises.clicks
- `EB_REL_STEP` - the button is released after the step
- `EB_REL_STEP_C` - the button is released after the step with a border.clicks

> The result of the function `Action ()` is reset after the next call `tick ()`, that is, is available on the entire current iteration of the main cycle

The obtained event code can be processed through `switch`:
`` `CPP
switch (eb.action ()) {
  Case eb_press:
    // ...
    Break;
  Case eb_hold:
    // ...
    Break;
  // ...
}
`` `

<a id="OPTIMISE"> </a>

## Optimization
#### Library weight
To maximally reduce the weight of the library (in particular in RAM), you need to set the Timatui constants through Define (saving 1 bytes per timaut), turn off the events processor, counters-buffers and use the T-class (saving 1 byte per pin):
`` `CPP
#define eb_no_for
#define eb_no_callback
#define eb_no_counter
#define eb_no_buffer
#define eb_deb_time 50 // Timesout to extinguish the trim button (button)
#define eb_click_time 500 // Click Stayout (button)
#define eb_hold_time 600 // Maintenance Times (button)
#define eb_step_time 200 // Impulse retention Timesout (button)
#define EB_FAST_TIME 30 // TIMAUT RAM (ENCODER)
#include <encbutton.h>
ENCBUTTONT <2, 3, 4> EB;
`` `
In this case, an encoder with a button will take only 8 bytes in SRAM, and just a button - 5.

#### Fulfillment speed
To reduce the time for checking the system flags of events (insignificantly, but pleasant), you can place all the polls in the condition by `tick ()`, since `tick ()` returns `true` only when ** events **: the events **:
`` `CPP
VOID loop () {
  if (eb.tick ()) {
    if.turn ()) ...;
    if.click ()) ...;
  }
}
`` `

Also, a survey of events using the `Action () function is performed faster than a manual survey of individual functions of events, so the library will work in this format as efficiently as possible:
`` `CPP
VOID loop () {
  if (eb.tick ()) {
    switch (eb.action ()) {
      Case eb_press:
        // ...
        Break;
      Case eb_hold:
        // ...
        Break;
      // ...
    }
  }
}
`` `

For polling ** states ** buttons `Pressing ()`, `Holding ()`, `WATING ()` You can place them inside the conditions of `BUSY ()` so as not to interview them until they are guaranteed:
`` `CPP
if (btn.busy ()) {
  if (btn.pressing ()) ...
  if (btn.holding ()) ...
  if (btn.waiting ()) ...
}
`` `

<a id="callback"> </a>

### Collback
You can connect the external feature of the event, it will be caused when any event occurs.This opportunity works in all classes ** with the ** button:
- `virtbutton`
- `Button`
- `virtencbutton`
- `encbutton`

`` `CPP
ENCBUTTON EB (2, 3, 4);

Void callback () {
  switch (eb.action ()) {
    Case eb_press:
      // ...
      Break;
    Case eb_hold:
      // ...
      Break;
    // ...
  }
}

VOID setup () {
  eb.attach (callback);
}

VOID loop () {
  eb.tick ();
}
`` `

<a id="duble"> </a>

### Simultaneous pressing
The library supports work with two simultaneously pressed buttons as with the third button.For this you need:
1. Cut the virtual button`virtbutton`
2. Call the processing of real buttons
3. Pass these buttons to the virtual button to process (these can be objects of classes `virtbutton`,` button`, `encbutton` + their` t`- version)
4. Next to interrogate events

`` `CPP
Button b0 (4);
Button b1 (5);
Virtbutton B2;// 1

VOID loop () {
  b0.tick ();// 2
  b1.tick ();// 2
  B2.Tick (B0, B1);// 3

  // 4
  if (b0.click ()) serial.println ("b0 click");
  if (b1.click ()) serial.println ("b1 click");
  if (b2.click ()) serial.println ("b0+b1 click");
}
`` `

The library itself will “drop” unnecessary events from real buttons if they were pressed together, with the exception of the event `Press`.Thus, a full -fledged third button of two others with a convenient survey is obtained.

<a id="isr"> </a>

## interrupt
### encoder
For processing an encoder in a loaded program you need:
- Connect both of his pins to hardware interruptions by `Change`
- install `setencisr (true)`
- call a special ticker for interruption in the handler
- The main ticker also needs to be called in `loop` for corrething work - events are generated in the main ticker:
`` `CPP
// Example for Atmega328 and Encbutton
ENCBUTTON EB (2, 3, 4);

/*
// ESP8266/ESP32
IRAM_ATTR VOID ISR () {
  eb.tickisr ();
}
*/

VOID isr () {
  eb.tickisr ();
}
VOID setup () {
  Attachinterrupt (0, Isr, Change);
  Attachinterrupt (1, ISR, Change);
  eb.setencisr (true);
}
VOID loop () {
  eb.tick ();
}
`` `

Note: The use of work in the interruption allows you to correctly process the encoder position and not miss a new turn.An event with a turn obtained from an interruption will become available * after * call `Tick` in the main cycle of the program, which allows not to violate the sequence of the main cycle:
- Buferization is disabled: the `turn` event is activated only once, regardless of the number of clicks of the encoder made between the two challenges of` tick` (clicks are processed in interruption)
- The buffering is included: the `turn` event will be caused as many times as there were really clicks of the encoder, this allows you to not miss the turns and not load the system in the interruption.** Boofer size - 5 unprocessed clicks of encoder **

Notes:
- The `setencisr` function works only in non - virtual classes.If it is turned on, the main ticker `tick` simply does not interview Encoder's pins, which saves processor time.Processing occurs only in interruption
- The encoder counter is always relevant and can be ahead of buffering turns in the program with large delays in the main cycle!
- on different interrupt platforms can work in different ways (for example, on ESPXX - you need to add the functions of the atrica `` IRAM_ATTR`, see documentation on your platform!)
- a processor connected to `Attach ()` will be called from `Tick ()`, that is, *not from interruption *!

### virtual classes
In the virtual ones there is a ticker in which it is not necessary to transmit the state of the encoder, if it is processed in an interruption, this allows you to not interview pins in idle.For example:

`` `CPP
Virtencoder e;

VOID isr () {
    E.tickisr (DigitalRead (2), DigitalRead (3));
}
VOID setup () {
    Attachinterrupt (0, Isr, Change);
    Attachinterrupt (1, ISR, Change);

    E.Setencisr (1);
}
VOID loop () {
    E.tick ();// Do not transmit the states of Pinov
}
`` `

#### Button
To process the button in the interruption, you need:
- Connect an interruption on ** press ** buttons taking into account its physical connection and level:
  - if the button closes `Low` - Interruption` Falling`
  - if the button closes `high` - interruption` rising`
- call `Pressisr ()` in the interruption processor

`` `CPP
Button b (2);

/*
// ESP8266/ESP32
IRAM_ATTR VOID ISR () {
  B.Pressisr ();
}
*/

VOID isr () {
  B.Pressisr ();
}
VOID setup () {
  Attachinterrupt (0, ISR, Falling);
}
VOID loop () {
  B.tick ();
}
`` `

Note: the button is processed mainly `tick ()`, and the function `Pressisr ()` just informs the library that the button was pressed outside `Tick ()`.This allows you not to miss the pressing of the button until the program was busy with something else.

<a id="array"> </a>

### Array of buttons/Encoder
WITHThe cranberries can be naked only from non -step classes (without the letter `t`), because Pinov’s numbers will have to be indicated already in the radime further in the program.For example:
`` `CPP
Button btns [5];
ENCBUTTON EBS [3];

VOID setup () {
  btns [0] .init (2);// Indicate the pin
  btns [1] .init (5);
  btns [2] .init (10);
  // ...

  EBS [0] .init (11, 12, 13, Input);
  EBS [1] .init (14, 15, 16);
  // ...
}
VOID loop () {
  for (int i = 0; i <5; i ++) btns [i] .Tick ();
  for (int i = 0; i <3; i ++) EBS [i] .Tick ();

  if (btns [2] .Click ()) serial.println ("BTN2 click");
  // ...
}

- `Clearflags ()` replaced by `Clear ()` (drop the flags of events) and `reset ()` (drop systemic flags of processing, finish processing)

### Logic of Work
In the V3, the functions of an event survey (Click, Turn ...) are not discarded immediately after their call - they are discarded at the next call `Tick ()`, thus retain their meaning in all subsequent challenges on the current iteration of the main cycle of the program.** Therefore, `tick ()` needs to be called only 1 time per cycle, otherwise there will be missions of actions! ** Read about this above.

## bugs and feedback
Create ** Issue ** when you find the bugs, and better immediately write to the mail [alex@alexgyver.ru] (mailto: alex@alexgyver.ru)
The library is open for refinement and your ** pull Request ** 'ow!

When reporting about bugs or incorrect work of the library, it is necessary to indicate:
- The version of the library
- What is MK used
- SDK version (for ESP)
- version of Arduino ide
- whether the built -in examples work correctly, in which the functions and designs are used, leading to a bug in your code
- what code has been loaded, what work was expected from it and how it works in reality
- Ideally, attach the minimum code in which the bug is observed.Not a canvas of a thousand lines, but a minimum code
